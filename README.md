# project1.1

# using Excel
# using fe2010 identified potential predictors
# simplie linear regression using fe2010
# split data into 3 samples
# 3 different regression models using 2 samples at a time and evaluating each model using the other sample
# average of the three models
# predicting FE using the average of the three models for data fe2011

# using MySQL
# creted databas fuel_economy
# uploaded tables fe2011 and fe2010 using import wizard
# added primary key to the tables fe2010 and fe2011
# added beta0 and beta1 values to the table fe2010
# predicted fe value of data fe2011 using the beta0 and beta1 values from fe2010
# final tables fe2010 and fe2011 are exported as .csv files
